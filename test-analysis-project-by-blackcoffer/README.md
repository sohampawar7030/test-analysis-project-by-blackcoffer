Project Title: Data Extraction and Text Analysis for Blackcoffer Company

Project Overview:
The aim of this project is to perform data extraction and text analysis for Blackcoffer Company, focusing on extracting insights, patterns, and valuable information from unstructured text data. This project involves utilizing various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and tools to extract meaningful insights from textual data sources.

Project Objectives:

Data Collection: Gather unstructured text data from various sources such as customer reviews, social media, emails, and other relevant sources related to Blackcoffer Company.

Data Preprocessing: Clean the collected data by removing noise, irrelevant information, and standardizing the text format to prepare it for analysis.

Text Extraction: Utilize techniques like web scraping, APIs, and manual extraction to gather textual data from different platforms and sources.
